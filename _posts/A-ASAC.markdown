Automatically generating spatial audio (like Dolby Atmos) for scenes in movies/videos using video understanding. Designed a system that handles complex multi-speaker environments, identity switching and occlusions by leveraging lightweight tracking and facial recognition methods. 
\item Currently working on using scene understanding to generate better spatial audio even in the absence of proper visual cues.
