- Designed a complete pipeline for 3D reconstruction of an object using a monocular fixed camera.
- Optimized the initial 3D reconstruction with ICP, pose graph optimization, and Bundle Adjustment for efficient and accurate results; Proposed future enhancements by utilizing NeRFs to learn appearance geometry.
