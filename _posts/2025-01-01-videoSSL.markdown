- Developed a system that combines semantic and temporal information to localize sound sources in videos
- Audio-visual grounding by aligning a large Vison-Language Model’s embeddings with audio embeddings (similar to ”Can
CLIP Help Sound Source Localization?”)
- Addresses video challenges, including unidentified frames and instance disambiguation through our custom temporal
module that utilizes a audio-motion transformer
