- Automatically generating spatial audio (like Dolby Atmos) for scenes in movies/videos using video understanding. Designed a system that handles complex multi-speaker environments, identity switching and occlusions by leveraging lightweight tracking and facial recognition methods. 
- Currently working on using scene understanding to generate better spatial audio even in the absence of proper visual cues.
