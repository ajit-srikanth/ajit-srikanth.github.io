- Designed a walker robot with 8 klann linkage mechanims for legs, performing comprehensive kinematics and dynamics analysis with consideration for different gaits for different purposes, on Fusion360.
- Built the mechanism using laser-cut acrylic for links and chassis, with 3D-printed joints and couplers.
- Wrote a simple controller to control the two dynamixel XL330 motors using U2D2 for communication.
