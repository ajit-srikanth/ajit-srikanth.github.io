- Designed a walker robot with 8 klann linkage mechanims for legs, along with complete kinematics and dynamics analysis with consideration for different gaits for different purposes, on Fusion360.
- Fabricated and assembled the designed mechanism by laser-cutting acrylic sheets for the links, chassis and 3D printed the joints and couplers.
- Wrote a simple controller to control the two dynamixel XL330 motors using U2D2 for communication.
