- Automatically generating spatial audio (like Dolby Atmos) for movie scenes using video understanding.
- Developed a system for complex multi-speaker environments with identity switching, and occlusions, using lightweight tracking, facial recognition and Active Speaker Detection techniques.
- Currently working on improving spatial audio generation in scenes lacking proper visual cues through advanced scene understanding.
