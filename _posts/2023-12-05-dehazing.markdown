- Implementation of various haze removal methods including Bayesian defogging, Single image haze removal using Dark Channel Prior, Single image haze removal using Colour Attenuation Prior.
- Improved upon the DCP prior paper, by adding an additional preprocessing step which increases the restored image quality by utilizing CLAHE; Demonstrated their use in stream tasks like object detection.
- Extensively benchmarked these algorithms along with other classical methods without a degradation model, and analyised their performance.
