- Assembled a mecanum wheel robot with four Planetary Gear DC Motor driven by two Cytron Mdds30.
- Integrated and calibrated, a Realsense T265 tracking camera and a Realsense D455 depth camera, along with voxfield for obtaining ESDFs utilized for motion planning.
- Implemented several planning algorithms, including CEM, MPPI, and MPC, on an onboard Intel NUC, utilizing ESDFs for collision costs; designed and implemented a PID controller for path-following.
